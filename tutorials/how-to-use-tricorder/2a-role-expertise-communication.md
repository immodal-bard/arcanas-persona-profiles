# Where is Role?

If you've read my Prompt Persona tutorial, you know that I stressed the importance of defining Role, Expertise, and Communication. Yet, with Arcanas, they are missing. Why?

As important as they are for the AI to include them in personas, as that is how the AI looks at persona design, in the case of Arcanas, I have found that sometimes they can overpower the personality aspect of a persona. As mentioned in the Arcanas tutorial, the main advantage of using fictional characters is that the AI already knows who they are and can help fill in the blanks. They can actually do this without the Arcanas. Yet, if I include Role, Expertise, and Communication, the AI can prioritize that information, taking away from the characteristics you want from the Arcanas.

Mind you, this is not always the case. And you are welcomed to add Role, Expertise, and Communication (which is a combination of Tone and Style). I use these three in AI Advanced Persona Profiles and AI Complex Persona Profiles, but for Arcanas, I don't use them to make sure the AI always brings the extra characteristics. I also know that the AI will autogenerate Role, Expertise, and Communication based on the Big Five NEO-PI-R Essence Rubric and the context of my prompt, as well as what it already knows of the fictional character.

So, even to my rules, there is always an exception.
