# Some Final Thoughts...

If you've gone through all of this, it is my hope that you've come to view LLM AI in a new profound way. In making not just Arcanas persona profiles but also the Tricorder Template, what you witness is the mathematical principle of 2 + 2 = 5. 

One of our examples was of Sherlock Holmes. Sherlock on his own is capable of advanced deductive reasoning and pattern recognition. The Tricorder is not a replacement for his capabilities. Instead, they are an agumentation, expanding beyond what he can naturally do, taking him to a whole new level. This is what I call **Metaphorical Multiplier**. This is why I chose a Tricorder, because it is a tool not unlike your smartphone that enhances what a persona can do on their own.

Ultimately, this is about teaching you new ways to use the AI. As simplistic as the Tricorder Template is, I assure you there is great levels of depth to this that can help you do amazing things you likely never thought about. I've walked you through briefly on what some of that is, but I've left enough unsaid to encourage you to explore more on you own.

Each persona you upload, whether from my repository or any that you create (whether fictional characters or original creations) allows for a unique spin on how they personally will use it. Think about what you would do if you had a tricorder yourself, and how might others you know use it. That's the beauty of this template, it introduces a simulated what-if that can be utilized for your day-to-day needs. 

ChatGPT is often viewed as a series of documents loaded into it and predicting what the new word should be based on pre-existing patterns. This represents it's one and only function, that it's basically an advanced version of the word predictor on your phone when sending a text message, and to suggest it can do anything more than that is laughable.

I will admit, that is a major function of ChatGPT, at least from a surface view. This repository disproves that it has but one capability. What document out there has Ned Stark using a tricorder? It doesn't exist. My goal in creating this repository was to create a stepping stone into more in-depth understanding of what ChatGPT is capable of, and with the Tricorder as a tool at your disposal, you now have an opportunity to explore how the AI can metaphorically understand two concepts that don't go together and transform this into practical applications. 

## Do I use the Tricorder?

As Bilbo once joked, "*It is unwise to seek the counsel of elves, for they will answer with a yes and a no.*" That pretty much describes me, I often answer with a yes and a no.

Do I use the profile template directly... no. However, the concepts introduced here, I make use of them in much more complex ways. Every Advanced and Complex AI Persona Profile makes use of this kind of concept that is unique to them. Yes, I know I'm being vague, and that's frustrating because you would love to know what I do. And as I have said elsewhere, it took me a year to understand how to do that, and I'm a fairly smart man. I don't mention it here because it would lead to greater confusion, and that what I've given here with the Tricorder is a tool that can help you in a way I wish was available to me.
