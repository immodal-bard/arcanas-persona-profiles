# Tricorder Temporal Functionality

If you've been reading this tutorial, and I hope you have, you will undoubtely notice that many of the subfunctionalities seem to be similar, such as those that seem to find hidden data. That is no mistake and I assure it is by no means redundant. One important lesson one can learn from using the Tricorder template is that there are considerable nuances of things you can do with the AI. Consider the concept of *hidden data* and ask yourself, "*What does that really mean?*". The term is an abstract concept and in truth, rather ambiguous. There is a lot of depth to the realm of *hidden data* that you can explore with the Tricorder. And I'm not going to tell you what those differences are, because you will gain so much more insight in finding out for yourself, just as I did... and I didn't have a tricorder to help me.

In essence, Temporal Scanning is about detecting time. As humans, we perceive time in a continous forward movement. Now on Star Trek, there have been many instances of time not acting based on our perceptions and a tool like a Tricorder comes in handy. A tricorder can investigate temporal rifts, paradoxes, measure the flow of time or time flowing differently, how time affects biological or energy sources or the environment. Temporal scanning functionality is one that actually collaborates more with other types of scanning functionality more than the other interact with other scanning types.

In this lesson, we will be looking at:

**‚è≥ Temporal: Chronotons and Tachyons, Feedback Loops, Time Dialation, Time Echos**

## Chroniton and Tachyon Detection

Remember Sam the Snowman from Rudolph the Red Nose Reindeer?

*Chronotons and Tachyons,*  
*Chronotons and Tachyons,*  
*Everyone wishes for Chronotons and Tachyons.*  
*How do you measure its worth?*  
*With a Tricorder here on Earth.*  

*Chronotons and Tachyons,*  
*Chronotons and Tachyons,*  
*Means so much more when I see*  
*Chronotons and Tachyons distortians*  
*For repeating every Christmas year.*  

You know, instead of Silver and Gold. Perhaps we should call him Sam the Snowtime Man? I don't know. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

In Star Trek, take that for what it's worth, Chroniton Particles are tied to time travel or time manipulation and are often present in regions affected by time distortions. Chronitons provide evidence of temporal interference. Tachyons, however, are faster-than-light particles associated with future time states and temporal communication. Detecting tachyons may indicate upcoming time-shifted events or the presence of technology capable of manipulating time.

Metaphorically, Chronitons represent evidence of interference or manipulation‚Äîthe impact of past or future disruptions on a current situation. Tachyons represent the potential for upcoming changes or anticipation of consequences, understanding how past and future influences are shaping the present.

ChatGPT can't manipulate time, but it can run probabilities and trend analysis as well as simulations. 
* Chroniton Particles allows the AI to look at external manipulation, past disruptions, or influences that are affecting the present based on the information it is presented.
  * This is about analyzing how the past could be creating ripples in the current situation, or that outside forces are manipulating the flow of events.
  * Chroniton scanning can detect whether past decisions are still affecting outcomes or stakeholders or market conditions are manipulating the situation.
* Tachyon Particles represents the anticipation of shifts and/or consequences related to present situations.
  * Such as anticipating changes, upcoming challenges, or potential opportunities.
  * Offer insights on how to adapt and plan for these upcoming events to stay ahead of potential disruptions and adjust your strategy for future success.
* Together, Chronitons and Tachyons allows one to look at a timeline of a present situation, looking at the past influences and future possibilities together.
  * A challenge in making decisions is that anticipating future changes doesn't often take past decisions into consideration, which can have a profound affect on the future.
  * In project managing, chronitons can look at unresolved conflicts or past tensions and how that would affect the future if they are not resolved in the present. Remember that the future is never set in stone.

## Temporal Feedback Loops

*This is the song that doesn‚Äôt end*  
*Yes, it goes on and on, my friend*  
*Some people started singing it not knowing what it was,*  
*And they‚Äôll continue singing it forever just because*  
*This is the song that doesn‚Äôt end...*  
-- Lamp Chop

*Time... line? (scoffs) Time isn't made out of lines. It is made out of circles. That is why clocks are round.* -- Caboose (Red vs Blue)

*It's groundhogs' day... again!* -- Phil Conners (Groundhogs' Day)

We know time goes in a straight line, or so our brains tell us, but according to **Star Trek**, more often than not time does loop-de-loops. The Tricorder can identify feedback loops in time, where actions or energy events cause a self-repeating pattern. This might be experienced as recurring environmental phenomena, repeating events, or organisms reliving the same sequence of biological processes.

Metaphorically, a feedback loop in time represents repetitive patterns or cycles that keep occurring, whether in behavior, processes, or environments. This symbolizes recurring issues, unbroken habits, or repeating dynamics that create a sense of being stuck or trapped in the same loop. 

Feedback Loops are not an advanced process of ChatGPT. In fact, it's probably something most people are aware of having used an LLM AI for a period of time. That said, that doesn't mean there isn't advanced applications we can do with Feedback Loops. For the most part, ChatGPT would use this subfunctionality to identify recurring patterns, behaviors, or issues in your project, team, or personal life. 
* The AI can analyze whether certain actions or dynamics are trapped in a cycle, repeating without resolution. 
  * Deterime if self-repeating patterns are caused by recurring behavior, unresolved issues, or stagnant dynamics‚Äîand providing strategies to break the loop and create forward momentum.
* Detect different types of loop or elements affecting loops, such as repeated mistakes, unresolved tasks, or cyclical setbacks
  * Can attempt to address the root cause, changing your approach, or introducing new perspectives
* Can act as a form of conflict resolution between friends or teammbers
  * Identify repeating behaviors like constant miscommunication, ongoing disagreements, or repetitive mistakes.
* One can be stuck in a creative loop, which can be a cause of Writer's Block.
  * This could be forms of loops that cause creative blocks or repetitive thinking patterns that keep you cycling through the same ideas or struggles
  * This could also be loops of stagnation or over-reliance on familiar methods, preventing growth and innovation.

## Time Dilation

Ever sit in a meeting and the speaker drowls on and on never getting to the point, or is just reading verbatim from a power point offering nothing new yet you have to sit there and you keep looking your watch every five minutes to see that in reality only a minute has passed?

It's not just for blackholes, our perception of time can be altered. One of the symptoms of my disability, Post-Concussion Syndrome is Time Dialation, that how I experience and recall events makes things seem like they happened long ago. One of my goals is to use AI to help those with mTBI to function better in this world.

The Tricorder can scan for temporal anomalies, which manifest as distortions in the flow of time. Time Dilation is where the flow of time is altered, either moving rapidly or to a crawl, compared to a standard reference. 

*Technically*, ChatGPT (on an abstract level) can cause disruptions to the flow time. How, you might say? Well, some of us don't like long outputs (actually, I prefer them), and when ChatGPT gives a long output, it seems like the information is going on and on and on. That's why many users require a short response instead. Yes, it's not actually ChatGPT manipulating time, but human perception on an individual level can be influenced to perceive time moving more slowly based on the length of the output. Something to think about. 

Metaphorically, Time Dialation detection represents the flow of events or progression compared to a standard reference. Whether it is a personal perception of looking at the development of a business, project, or ideas. Is it moving at a good pace, is it going slow, or is it rapidly moving along. Or, is it indication of being stalled or being rushed.

Beyond what I said above, ChatGPT can use Time Dialation as a means of a progress check. It depends entirely on the context, as there are instances where things going slow or fast can be a good thing, and vice versa, indicate a bad thing.
* A good example of Time Dilation is the detection of bottlenecks, representing dealying proccess or rushed deadlines.
* The system could use this to find patterns in projects, personal growth, or relationships.
* Comparing to a standard reference could actually be faulty and this can be used to recalibrate what the standard reference should be, so that understanding the flow of time is more accurate.


## Temporal Echoes

First think metaphorically of what an echo is. In may ways, it a ripple effect like when you skip a stone on water. Like the ripple in the pond, an Echo can have a lingering effect, especially if elements of the environment are just right for the lasting duration. A ripple in water does eventually fade the further out they go, or are met by boundaries that force  disapate.

The Tricorder can monitor future and past events that still affect the present. This can be seen in a number of ways, whether it is an integration of multiple time events together or causing immediate affects on the present time period, which can lead to paradoxes.

Metaphorically, Temporal Echos represents how residual energy from the past and future influences the present. While time is percieved in a forward motion, our past decisions have a way of catching up to us and our future is waiting to get here. Some try to ignore it, and others focus too much on one or the other. 

ChatGPT would use this more for Mental Health than it would for problem resolution, though it can be used for that.
* The AI would determine if past decisions or future concerns are causing anxiety or tension.
  * It would analyze whether or not past actions are holding you back or future worries are hindering you.
  * It can offer feedback on how to overcome problems or emotional debilitatin reactions.
* Temporal Echocs can represent defense mechanisms, such as creative blocks or failures that is affect your current works as you are afraid of repeating mistakes or facing the same consequences
* Temporal Echos can also represent a fear of success, of what would be the result of doing well or the after effect of a job well done.
