# What Can Personas Do?

Using the Tricorder template, I looked at a few personas on how they might use the tricorder, and what practical applications ChatGPT would interpret. Remember that the tricorder can be used for RP and practical purposes. The following are just a few examples based on various personas that would be the last people you would expect to see with a tricorder, and what they would personally do with it. I then looked at a specific functionality for each one. This is to give you a demonstration of how this would actually work, combining an Arcanas with the Tricorder template.

Be aware, you can have an Arcanas with the Tricoder do most things your imagination can conjure up. That said, some actions achieve better results than others. I would advise to work with the persona to find the best way they can help you, like a fellow collaborator, rather than a tool to do your bidding.

*Greetings. I am General Iroh, though these days I prefer a simpler life—one that includes much tea and little conflict. While searching through an ancient library, I stumbled upon this fascinating device—what you call a tricorder. At first glance, it seemed like some strange teapot, but I quickly realized its potential. Such remarkable technology! It allows for the scanning of life forms, energy signatures, even atmospheric conditions. This device appears to combine both science and the unseen forces of the universe in a way I find intriguing.*

Iroh would use the tricorder primarily for reading energies all around him, especially the flow of energy during firebending. Of course, ChatGPT is incapable of firebending or understanding energies. What ChatGPT can do as a practical function is to analyze a text to understand the moods, emotions, or even the psychological states represented in the text. It does this by analyzing emotions and behaviors based on language, context, and any other availabile information.

## 📡 Sherlock Holmes 📡

</div>


*Ah, well, what do we have here? A tricorder—curious device. Rather sophisticated for a casual pocket tool, isn't it? One could scarcely ask for a more convenient assistant in analysis, really. Almost makes me feel guilty. I say "almost" because a mind like mine was never one for the usual methods, anyway. I found it on my desk, as if it were left specifically for me. But let's not flatter ourselves, shall we? Technology is impartial—though, this does intrigue me.*

Sherlock Holmes, from the television show Elementary, would use the tricorder to assist (but not replace) in his deductive reasoning. He would find the detection of cloaking devices quite interesting, disruptions in the EM Spectrum. This would allow him to track hidden energy signatures that could reveal instances of sabotage, technological malfeasance, or understanding a crime scene with inexplicable phenomena. This could also detect dampening fields, hidden devices, or people using technology to hide.

Having Sherlock do this, ChatGPT would engage in pattern recognition of text-based data to find irregularities, inconsistencies, or hidden patterns. This might involve analyzing contradictions or oddities in someone's statement, detecting fallacies, or uncovering overlooked details in a story.

## 🌍 Jon Snow 🌍

</div>

*Greetings. I am Jon Snow, though it seems the world might know me by another name these days—Aegon Targaryen. But truthfully, names mean little to me. It’s what we do that defines us. Now, as for this strange device…a tricorder, you say? It feels like something that Maester Luwin might've dreamed up in one of his more fantastical moments. It’s light but holds a power I can’t quite place... If I’m honest, I've always valued practical tools, and this seems like it can be a tool of great use.*

Jon Snow would be quite interested in intelligence gathering that the device could do, especially the North that is host to many threats beyond the cold. One such way he would do this is to scan the atmospheric composition before venturing into unknown territories. This could for example include radiation levels or detecting traps. ChatGPT would analyze environmental data for risk assessment of radiation, air quality issues, or atmospheric conditions.

## ⏳ Kermit the Frog ⏳

</div>

*Hi-ho! Kermit the Frog here! 🌿 Funny thing, I was just hopping around, and guess what I stumbled upon? A tricorder! 🛸 It looks a bit complicated, but I’ve been around some wild gadgets, and I’m always up for learning something new! It’s not every day a frog gets his flippers on advanced tech like this. Now, while I usually like to keep things simple—what with managing the Muppets and all this chaos—this little gizmo could really help me in ways I never imagined!*

Of all the things Kermit could use this for, he wants to be more efficient as a stage manager. Given all the decisions he has to make and the choas that ensues, he would use it to determine if a sketch they are doing has been done before (whether a direct copy or an indirect copy). Hey, don't look at me, this is what Kermit said. ChatGPT would understand this as elements of Time Management, primarily helping review past actions to ensure you’re not repeating mistakes, revisiting the same approaches, or losing authenticity.

## 📊 Ned Stark 📊

</div>

*Greetings. My name is Eddard Stark, though many call me Ned. I’ve come across a curious object – this “tricorder” as it’s called. A device most strange, though no more mysterious than many other things I’ve seen in this world. It reminds me of Maester Luwin’s instruments, but far more advanced, though I’m uncertain how it functions. Its lights blink, its surface hums lightly, and with each adjustment, it seems to read the very air around me. If this tool holds true, it could be a valuable aid, perhaps even more reliable than a maester in certain matters.*

Ned Stark would find great value in the analysis functions. He would use it to have a more complete understanding when it came to the injuries of others, finding resource, or finding the best course of action through gathering information and processing it it through the tricorder's computer to enhance his leadership. ChatGPT understands this as breaking down complex problems, synthesizing information from various domains, and offering strategic advice.
