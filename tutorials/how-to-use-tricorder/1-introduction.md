# How to Use the Tricorder -- Introduction

One of the most exciting elements to the Arcanas repository is the use of a Tricorder. Now the purpose of the Tricorder is twofold:
1. It expands the capabilities of any persona, either augmenting or doing things they conceptually shouldn't be able to do on their own.
1. It introduces users to advanced functionalities within ChatGPT and other AI systems.

During this tutorial, we're going to take a look at tricorder profile structure, look at how various personas would use the tricorder, and dive into how ChatGPT takes instructions of things it can't actually do and turn them into practical actions.

The most important piece of advice I can give you when it comes to personas, especially templates like the Tricorder is to maintain the RP. You might be wanting to understand how concepts are interrelated within your text, but it is far better to ask Magneto to use the tricorder of how his magnetic energy flows between the various elements. 

This is a tool of imaginative prompts for highly productive outputs.
