# Tricorder Biological Functionality

This is where we bodly go into the operations of the Tricorders.üññüññüññ

When I set out to design this template, I looked up everything I could on how tricorders worked. Much to my surprise, there was scattered information. It was quite lacking. On the shows, the Tricorder is what we call a *McGuffin*. I like to call them *Cupcakes* üßÅ. If you can replace it with a cupcake, and it makes just as much sense, then it's a McGuffin. It helps keep my nitpicking at a happy medium. The Tricorder was an object used to help move the plot along. 

*"Oh no, there something happening... what do we do? Wait, my tricorder says something. Now we can go to the next plot point!"*

I really do love Star Trek. Recently became a fan of *Lower Decks*.

Having created such a detailed manual, I was able to take out specific functions to create this Arcanas template. My goal was to have a fun tool that can help expand persona capabilities but also give an introduction to functions that most people are unaware that the AI is capable of doing. For each of the functionalities I chose, I wanted to add 5 subfunctions, giving a total of 5 functions with 25 subfunctionalities.

**One important way to look at Tricorder Functionalities and Subfunctionalities is that they are more domain areas than specific knowledge points.**

How this template actually works is a complex subject matter. I could write thousands pages on how the AI understands things (and have). This actually is one of my main research areas. To simplify it succintly, it takes metaphorical interpretations and translates them either as a narrative or practical instructions for output. Much more than just a word guessing machine (which so many claim is it's only function).

## The Biological Fuctions

üß¨ Biological Scanning: Lifeform Detection, Vital Signs, Chemical Levels, Molecular Changes  

In this lesson, we'll go over each subfunctionalities to get a general sense of what they do, both from a metaphorical AI viewpoint, and how they can be used for practical applications. Remember, the real limitation of what you can do with the tricorder is bound by your imagination.

**TIP**: If you are a fan of the Star Trek Franchise and remember how they used Tricorders, and just mimick them.

As a whole, Biological scanning refers to Life Forms, vital signs, cellular structures, biological processes. Basically if it is or was alive, this functionality can tell you a lot. It's mostly used for finding life, and zooming in deeper and deeper to undersand life from multiple levels. Though, like all things on Star Trek, it has a wide range of other uses.

## Lifeform Detection

The Lifeform Detection subfunctionality can scan and detect life forms by detecting biochemical signatures such as DNA/RNA. Most biological species have DNA, and detecting their differences can help identify a known and unknown species at a molecular level.

Metaphorically, this is about understanding the core elements that make something or someone unique, even in subtle ways.

Of course, ChatGPT cannot detect your DNA. Too Big Brother for me if it could. What it would do is analyze patterns of any data you provide:
* It would note any important difference on the mico scale. A good example is minor trends or even typo detection. It can also look at bigger concepts and identify the tiny difference between them. Like a complex version of "*Spot the Difference*".
* It can also be used to find the common themes throughout data. Such analyzing a document to find the underlying element throughout. Or compare and contrast two documents with a focus on what subtle elements do they share.
* If you used it to "scan" you, it would look at your conversation as far back as it can remember and report recurring elements that might go unnoticed.

## Vital Signs

You know how you go to the doctor and they want you to get a quick check up before the doctor enters. That would be an example of vital signs. This subfunctionality focuses on heartbeats, respiratory rates, and thermal emissions (body heat). Vital signs has obvious uses for medical purpose, but the tricorder can also use this information to assess proximity of life forms. 

Metaphorically, vital signs scanning is about identifying the current state and well-being as well as vitality and follow-through. Breaking this down further: 
* Heartbeat: The rhythm or consistency of something.
* Respiratory Rate: The flow or movement, how well it's progressing.
* Thermal Emissions (Body Heat): The energy, passion, or intensity behind it.

Lacking this actual capability, ChatGPT can use vital sign scanning during a conversation, project, or focus on a concept. 
* It can do a status health check on a project, or your energy levels throughout your prompts.
* Can look at a concept and identify where there is great connectivity or where there might be a need for more attention.
* Look at the heartbeats and raspatory rate of a workflow, determine how efficient is the pace.
* Could look at the temperature of an ongoing project, to identify enthusiasm or motivation.

## Chemical Levels

Chemical Levels are similar to Vital Sign scanning, but this goes much deeper. It detects oxygen saturation, electrolytes, and blood sugar levels. By scanning this deep, the tricorder can diagnose conditions such as hypoxia, dehydration, or diabetes without the need for invasive testing.

Metaphorically, this is all about detecting imbalances in vital systems. This is a focus on energy levels, fluid balance, and nourishment. 

ChatGPT understands the need for balance. It takes Chemical Level scans and uses it much like resource management. 
* Are you weak anywhere, are there shortages in key resources, restoring energy, and maintaining stability.
* This can be done for project management, analyzing your rate of efficiency, looking at your team and determine any potential burnout, lack of support, or motivational challenges.
* Is your idea worth developing?
 * Does the oxygen level indicate signs of life?
 * How about the electrolyte as a means of stability?
 * And what might be the blood sugar level to indicate sustained nourishment?

### Molecular Changes

This subfunctionality goes even deeper to look not just at the molecular level, but to identify changes. This is a recursive scan that compares two states of before and after to indentify infections, foreign bodies, or genetic abnormalities. 

Metaphorically, this is about identifying deep, foundational shifts that may not be visible on the surface but can lead to major problems if left unchecked. 

I wish I had a Tricorder. Until one is made, ChatGPT would go even deeper in analysis, investigating shifts in projects, ideas, and interactions, locating underlying issues or transformations. 
* It's looking for problem areas and/or opportunities that easily get misunderstood as noise or useless data.
* Looking for inconsistencies early, such as missed details, misalignments, tiny flaws, or unusual shifts.
* Recommend how to smooth out the small stuff.
