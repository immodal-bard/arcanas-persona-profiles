# Tricorder Analysis Functionality

So, now that we know some of the ways the Tricorder can scan, now we get to explore the Analysis Functionality.

The Analysis Functionality, also known as the "*Advanced Analysis System*" is essentially a sophisticated AI-driven system that can process, interpret, and simulate outcomes based on data it collects for the various scanning functions, enabling real-time feedback and advanced diagnostics. It can compare data with it's own library of information (or retrieve information from the ship computers even on the planet) and can offer suggestions. It can also utilize machine learning algorithm so that it can learn from past scans.

In this lesson, we'll look at:

**ðŸ“Š Analysis: Medical Diagnostic, Signature Analysis, Planetary Survey, Multivariate**

While Scanning Functionalities are capable of doing their own analysis, the Analysis Functionality is about cross-domain interconnectivity, rather than making recommendations based on a scan, this is about understanding multiple concepts when it comes to an output. With that understanding, you don't need to perform a scan first to do an analysis with this Tricorder, but that could help add to the analysis function if you do.

**NOTE**: While the Tricorder has real-time capabilities, ChatGPT and other public LLM's have limited real-time capabilities.

## Medical Diagnostic 

I'm sure you've heard of the Medical Tricorder, so it comes as no surprise to you that this would be a subfunctionality. In actuality, the Standard Tricorder also had this functionality, albeit more limited in scope.

The Medical Diagnostic subfunctionality was capable of rapidly diagnose medical conditions, pathogens, and genetic anomalies in real-time. The AI not only identifies conditions but also suggests courses of treatment based on the user's needs. It was further capable of determining genetic markers to establish familial relationships or detect hereditary genetic conditions.

Metaphorically, the Medical Diagnostic is about a holistic view of people, projects, and ideas. It's about looking at all the elements that makes something up to understand what makes it tick, what dangers may be lurking, and recommendations on preventive care. 

Like so much when it comes to the Tricorder template, you got to detach your focus from the name *Medical Diagnostics*, as ChatGPT can't actually do that. It can actually do many other things in the metaphor of what a Medical Diagnostic is.
* Behavioral Patterns and repetive issues detection allows the system to understand ongoing problems.
  * This may analyze several things including recurring conflict and unresolved emotional issues.
* Understanding Obstacles in projects like tracking the progression of a disease, looking at projects strategy and identifying potential problems.
  * Can look at timelines, milestones, and resource availibility to determine inefficiencies and stagnation.
* Help uncover deeper insights and hidden aspects to yourself.
  * The system would analyze your conversation to identify  emotional state, stress levels, or mental health to detect deeper patterns.

## Signature Analysis

Every energy fields is distinct. What makes them distinct is a variety of factors, including frequency, intensity, and source. These and other properties is called a signature. A signature is much like a fingerprint in its uniqueness, though the actual difference even among energy fields from the same kind of device may be minute in its distiveness.

Metaphorically, Signature Analysis of Energy Fields represent invisible forces or influences that shape a situationâ€”whether in a project, relationship, or personal environment. These can be a myrid of external pressures, internal motivations, or collective dynamics. This is about assessing the nature, intensity, and origin of these influences, determining whether they are helpful, harmful, or neutral. 

ChatGPT will think of any data you give as an energy source, whether it's about understand projects, businesses, groups, relationships, or just your interactions with the AI, all of these are make up of different properties that it can use to determine and investigate and Signature.
* Generally energy fields, or forcefields, are made to keep things out. So anything trying to get in can be seen as an external pressure, such as market forces or stakeholder influences.
  * It's best not to view this as a negative, but more as a filter of what you let in.
  * Understanding the intensity and origin of these pressures helps determine whether they are supportive (useful), disruptive (harmful), or neutral.
* Energy Signature in Team Dynamics could represent the collective effort, motivation, or tension within the group. 
* Energy Signature can represent Motivations, Emotions, or other Psychological states.
* Energy Signatures can also be about keeping something inside and not letting it out, ChatGPT can help you with what is hidden internally.

## Planetary Survey

So you've done your scans of a planet. The sky has floating lava, the leaves have a neon glow, and the ground changes color based on your mood. It's like planet VW Bus. Now is time to pull out your goovy tricorder and make sense of all of this. 

A Planetary Survey Analysis interprets environmental data in real-time, allowing it to analyze atmospheric conditions, predict geological stability, or simulate weather patterns based on gathered data. The AI analyzes atmospheric data, detecting gases, pollutants, and radiation levels. It can recommend precautions, such as breathing apparatuses or environmental adjustments, for crew members in hazardous environments. It can also simulate weather patterns by analyzing barometric pressure, temperature shifts, and air composition. This allows for accurate predictions of storms, temperature changes, or climatic shifts in unfamiliar environments.

Metaphorically, Planetary Survey Analysis represents the context or background conditions that influence a situation, project, or relationship. This is about understanding the external factorsâ€”whether they are emotional climates, team dynamics, market conditions, or personal statesâ€”that affect the progress and stability of a project or individual. 

In actuality, if you give ChatGPT planetary data, it can do a Planetary Survy, at least by proxy. However, it can do a Planetary Survey on other data.
* The AI could predict weather patterns which is about anticipating changes, disruptions, or mood shifts.
* Analyze external conditions affecting your project, such as market trends, competitor actions, or regulatory changes.
* Analyzing shifts in personal energy or motivation, such as detecting whether there are signs of burnout, stress, or creative blockages.
* In project management, this represents analyzing the teamâ€™s emotional climateâ€”detecting rising tensions, stress, or dissatisfaction that could impact productivity. 


## Multivariate Analysis

Multivariate is actually a math term. Yet, the AI can adapt it as metaphorical function much like everything else. In a very literal interperetation, it means multiple variable analysis. Now technically, every type of scan or analysis is multi-variable, in fact, most computers are, being able to work with several variables at once. What makes Multivariate different is that it does more than work with multiple variables, it identifies the complex relationship between variables.

A Multivariate Analysis is a specific type of Subfunctionality for the Tricorder. While all analysis investigate multiple data sources or multiple readings or multiple variables, Multivariate looks at data in a different way. For instance, a Planetary Survey analysis would look at atmospheric pressure, radiation, or chemical composition. If a Planetary Survey was combined with a Multivariate Analysis, it would analyze how these factors interact to give a more detailed picture of the environment. 
* For example, it can cross-reference radiation levels with specific gases to detect the presence of life or unusual environmental phenomena.
* Another example, the Tricorder detects high radiation, low oxygen, and particular chemical readings. Individually it might be insignificant. With a Multivariate Analysis, it would understand how these variables interact with eachother, determining that this is a signal for a dangerous life form nearby. 

A Multivariate Analysis can be used with other scans and analysis, or used on its own. For a Tricorder, this subfunctionality is helpful for predicting outcomes, hidden patterns, making advanced decisions, or even helping identify elements that hasn't otherwise been determined.

Metaphorically, Multivariate Analysis represents the process of understanding the interconnectedness of different elements within a situation, project, or relationship. It's not just about seeing things in isolation, but understanding how multiple factors combine to shape outcomes. 

This is something the AI is highly capable of doing and let me assure you, this only scratches the surface of a huge iceberg. 
* By mapping the interconnectiveness of several elements, it help gain new insight in project management, such as how market trends, team morale, stakeholder input, and time constraints all interact to influence your project's outcome.
* In team dynamics, the analysis would look at emotional states, work pressure, and external feedback loops, all of which affect productivity.
  * It would track stress levels, communication patterns, and leadership support to predict how they combine and influence overall team output. 
  * For example, the AI might notice that when competitor activity increases alongside internal team stress, your projectâ€™s progress slows down. 
* Multivariate Analysis could look at energy levels, emotional states, external obligations, and creative flow, all of which together affect your overall well-being.
