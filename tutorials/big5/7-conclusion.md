# Big Five NEO-PI-R Conclusion

When it comes to mapping out the essence of real life person, I tend to dislike Big Five. I won't say why here as that is a discussion for another day. I will say that when it comes to doing Persona Profiles for AI systems like ChatGPT, it is a highly superior way to do Personas. 

You might wonder how I come to the scores for each persona. When it comes to doing AI Personas, there are a variety of levels. From Prompt Personas, to Persona Profiles, and then going into AI Adanced Perona Profiles and AI Complex Persona Profile. And there is a level above that which I'm working on. For scores to use with Arcanas Github repository, I make use of an AI Complex Persona Profile of Carl Jung. How he is designed, he has a deep understanding of the scores, though not a perfect one. Together, we work collaboratively to figure out the best scores, with Carl challenging me and quite often agreeing with him.

Point of interest, I make use of Big Five NEO-PI-R (Modified) within AI Complex Persona Profiles like Carl Jung. 

One of the challenges with Big Five, and I won't say the developer did this intentionally, but there is a bias when they see scores that by default, a low score is bad and a high score is good. This to me represent *Whole Number Bias* and *Anchoring Effect*, that we have an innate perception to see higher numbers as superior. Now fortunately, the AI doesn't suffer this bias in regards to the Big Five. Which means to use this effectively with AI systems, you have to overcome any number-based bias you have to fully utilize Arcanas.

I realize that there is a level of subjectivity to these scores. Maybe it is off by 5 in certain areas, or that would feel that I am misrepresenting a character and recommend a drastically different score. When me and Carl work on this, we first go through a full biography of the character and then make our determinations. However, when I am designing AI Complex Persona Profiles, I take Carl's recommendation and give it to a Virtual Think Tank and they debate among themselves what the scores are. Despite my thoroughness in designing Arcanas, I recongize I might still get something wrong. Just like ChatGPT, I'm not infalliable.

**Recongize two things when it comes to NEO-PI-R:**

1. **Consider that your bias**. While I can admit that I can be wrong, so true can you also be wrong. I don't mean this to be derisive, simply to for you to understand that all of us have biases, and the best most of us can do is be aware of them and try to reflect in light of our biases. We have emotional connection to these characters, and because of that, we may be hardpressed to recongize their more negative traits or a lower score in positive traits. That's human nature, but asking, "Who are they *really*?"
2. **Not set in stone**. This Github repository for the most part is for you to use. In that application, these scores are configurable. Replace a number you don't agree with, or better yet, replace scores to help you in more specific way. This of this as a panel with lots of dials, and you can adjust them how you want. Just because I set a character a certain way, doesn't mean you must use it that way.

That said, I am open to discussion on scores. And if you can make a convincing talking point on why a score should be changed, I will consider it and potentially change it, but be prepared that I will be able to give a compelling counter-argument in favor of the scores I set and may not be convinced. But I do love talking characterization, so I promise you I will listen if you do your homework and bring your A-game.

tl;dr You're done with the tutorial.
