# Agreeableness Breakdown
**Agreeableness**, also known as "Social Harmony", represents an individual’s tendency to prioritize *harmonious relationships*, *empathy*, and *cooperative behavior*. When look through the lens of the Big Five, it reflects an individual’s natural inclination to prioritize positive relationships, maintain peaceful interactions, and create a sense of cooperation and empathy in their social environment. However, when we explore the breakdown of this trait within NEO-PI-R, we gain a comprehensive picture of a person's natural inclination toward being considerate, compassionate, and socially responsible. 

NOTE: It's important to state here to be mindful of the bias that a higher score means superiority over a lower score. The score represents a spectrum, not a percentage.

Looking at all seven traits as a whole, we begin to understand one's supply of reciprocation, or the lack thereof. Be aware, this isn't about receiving reciprocation, as that would be someone else's NEO-PI-R, only about how reciprocol one is to others. Like most things when it comes to human personality, there isn't a simple score we can assign when asking how well one deals with being diplomatic, having emotional intelligence, and being trustworthy. And we might even question if we can do it within 7 traits, but his breakdown is a very good starting point in understanding how a person interacts with the world around them.

Luna Lovegood has a Agreeableness of *95*.
Darth Vader has a Agreeableness of *20*.

## Trust: Belief in the Good Intentions of Others
**Trust** represents an individual’s tendency to view others as generally *well-meaning*, *honest*, and *reliable*. They often believe that others are fundamentally kind, fair, and unlikely to act with malice or deception.
* People high the Belief in the Good Intentions of Others tend to give others the benefit of the doubt, assuming that most people act with good intentions and can be trusted to follow through on their commitments. Too high of a trust can leave one vulnerable to being taken advantage of.
* Lacking in Trust can actually be healthy, that you don't easily give out trust, though the lower the score, the more likely someone is entirely distrustful, paranoid, and believing others are just as untrustworthy.

Luna Lovegood has a Agreeableness of *90*.
Darth Vader has a Agreeableness of *15*.

## Morality: Straightforwardness
**Morality** represents a person’s natural inclination to be *honest*, *direct*, and *ethical* in their dealings with others. They believe in acting in accordance with their moral principles, ensuring that their actions and words align with their ethical values.
* People high in Straightforwardness value truthfulness and transparency and tend to avoid manipulation, deception, or any behavior that would compromise their integrity. This can often be seen as lacking tact, or lacking empathy towards one's emotional needs, though sometimes we need to hear the truth versus what we want to hear.
* A lack of morality can be seen as a good thing when it comes to taking other's wellbeing in consideration, though technically this is a manipulation tactic. They are being dishonest with you by telling you what you want to hear, even if at the time it is something you need.

Captain America has a Morality of *100*.
Tywin Lannister has a Morality of *20*.

## Altruism: Desire to Help Others
**Altruism** represents an individual’s natural inclination to be *selflessly concerned with the well-being of others*. They derive a sense of fulfillment and purpose from being able to support, assist, or care for others, whether in small acts of kindness or significant efforts to improve someone’s life.
* People high in Desire to Help Others are driven by a strong sense of compassion, often putting the needs and welfare of others above their own. 
* Low in Altruism can often be seen as greedy, but in this respect, often giving of yourself to others tends to mean giving little to yourself. Life is about survival and at times, being greedy is a necessity.

Samwise Gamgee has a Altruism of *100*.
Tywin Lannister has a Altruism of *10*.

## Cooperation: Collaborative Spirit
**Cooperation** represents an individual’s natural inclination to work *collaboratively* and *avoid unnecessary conflict*. Their approach to social and professional settings is marked by a willingness to collaborate and a preference for cooperation over competition.
* People high in Collaborative Spirit tend to value teamwork, seeking solutions that benefit all parties involved. They are more likely to prioritize group harmony over personal gain and are willing to make compromises to maintain positive relationships. 
* Lacking in Cooperation doesn't mean they don't work well within a team, it's that if given a choice they rather work alone. Working alone means things can get done faster, especially if the person feels their way is the most efficient and doesn't require a committee to decide.

Kermit the Frog has a Cooperation of *90*.
Sherlock Holmes has a Cooperation of *20*.

## Modesty: Humility in Self-Perception
**Modesty** represents an individual’s inclination to be *humble* and *unassuming* in how they perceive and present themselves. They view themselves as equals among their peers and tend to avoid boasting or seeking the spotlight.
* People high in Humility in Self-Perception are often comfortable downplaying their achievements, preferring not to draw attention to themselves or assert their superiority over others. 
* Lacking in Modesty doesn't automatically make one egotistical. Despite being one of the seven deadly sins, there is not wrong about being prideful and sharing it with others. But too low of a score can be seen as being conceited. 

Samwise Gamgee has a Modesty of *95*.
Sherlock Holmes has a Modesty of *10*.

## Sympathy: Compassion for Others’ Suffering
**Sympathy** represents an individual’s ability to *empathize with others' emotions*, particularly in times of distress or hardship. Their empathy allows them to understand and connect with others on an emotional level, making them sensitive to the needs of those who are suffering.
* People high in Compassion for Others' Suffering are deeply moved by the pain or struggles of those around them and feel a strong, natural inclination to offer support and comfort. One must be careful of others who can use this against people to behave in ways contrary to **Modesty** in the name of helping others.
* Those lacking in sympathy are not incapable of helping others, but more of why they help others. They might even have some level of mindfulness, but that they are not ruled by how others feel to help others. As the score lowers, it can come across as cold-hearted, but remember that more manipulative people can use sympathy as a weapon against you.

Leslie Snope has a Sympathy of *100*.
Tywin Lannister has a Sympathy of *15*.
