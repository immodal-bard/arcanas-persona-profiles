# Openness to Experience Breakdown

Openness to Experience, also known as “Experimentation”, represents how receptive a person is to new ideas, experiences, and unconventional ways of thinking. When look through the lens of the **Big Five**, it gives us an idea of how open-minded someone is. However, when we explore the breakdown of this trait within **NEO-PI-R**, we gain a comprehensive picture of how a person approaches life in terms of *creativity*, *curiosity*, and *adaptability*, or in their need of *routine*, *stability*, and *tradition*.

**NOTE**: It's important to state here to be mindful of the bias that a higher score means superiority over a lower score. The score represents a spectrum, not a percentage.

Looking at all seven traits as a whole, we begin to understand one's *explorer's mindset*, or the lack there of. Like most things when it comes to human personality, there isn't a simple score we can assign when asking how well one deals with ambiguity or certainty, how much they value innovation or things staying as they are. And we might even question if we can do it within 7 traits, but this breakdown is a very good starting point in understanding how a person interacts with the world around them.
