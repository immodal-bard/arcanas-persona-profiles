# Neuroticism Breakdown

**Neuroticism**, also known as *"Emotional Instability"*, represents an individual’s *emotional reactivity*, *sensitivity to stress*, and overall *tendency toward emotional instability*. When look through the lens of the Big Five, Neuroticism reflects an individual’s overall emotional volatility and sensitivity to stress. However, when we explore the breakdown of this trait within NEO-PI-R, we gain a comprehensive picture of how easily a person experiences negative emotions, how strongly they react to life’s challenges, and how they cope with psychological pressure. 

NOTE: It's important to state here to be mindful of the bias that a higher score means inferiority over a higher score. The score represents a spectrum, not a percentage.

Looking at all seven traits as a whole, we begin to understand people being at their weakest state, or their strongest. Like most things when it comes to human personality, there isn't a simple score we can assign when asking how well one deals with controlling their emotionality, witnessing our worst selves, or how powerful emotions can often rob us of what we most desire. And we might even question if we can do it within 7 traits, but this breakdown is a very good starting point in understanding how a person interacts within their *inner*-world.

Obi-Wan "Ben" Kenobi has a Neuroticism of *20*.

## Anxiety: Tendency to Worry
**Anxiety** represents an individual’s propensity to feel *nervous*, *uneasy*, or *excessively concerned* about future events or potential problems. They are more likely to be hyper-aware of risks or dangers, and their mind may constantly race with "what if" scenarios about possible threats or failures.
* People with a high Tendency to Worry often find themselves frequently anticipating negative outcomes, feeling a sense of apprehension even when there may not be an immediate cause for concern.
* A low Anxiety doesn't mean that someone doesn't get nervous or feel uneasy, but it is that they aren't controlled by these feelings or can push them back when they interfere with their lives.

Mr. Feeny has an Anxiety of *15*.

## Anger: Frustration Response
**Anger** represents a person’s inclination to experience *anger*, *irritation*, or *frustration* in response to obstacles, setbacks, or perceived injustice. Their reaction to stressors often manifests as anger, ranging from mild irritation to intense frustration, depending on the situation.
* People with a high Frustration Response are more prone to emotional outbursts or feelings of resentment when things don’t go as planned or when they feel they have been treated unfairly. 
* Lacking Anger is more about not sweating the small stuff, that when met with failure, you're more likely to try again than emotionally react. However, this can lead to carelessness and a lack of learning opportunities.

Obi-Wan "Ben" Kenobi has an Anger of *20*.

## Depression: Tendency Toward Sadness
**Depression** represents an individual’s natural inclination to experience prolonged feelings of *sadness*, *hopelessness*, and *emotional low points*. This tendency can make it difficult for them to find joy or motivation in everyday life, and they may often feel disconnected from the positive emotions that others experience more easily.
* People high in Tendency Toward Sadness are more likely to feel weighed down by a sense of emotional heaviness or melancholy in response to challenges or setbacks. 
* Low in Depression doesn't mean a lack of depression necessarily. Remember that depression is a natural emotion to compensate high anxiety. It's more that their emotional low points are quicker to dissapate.

Jadzia Dax has a Depression of *20*.

## Self-Consciousness: Social Sensitivity
**Self-Consciousness** represents an individual’s *heightened awareness* of how others view and evaluate them in social situations. This awareness can lead to a sense of self-consciousness, where individuals frequently monitor their own behavior and worry about making mistakes or appearing inadequate in the eyes of others.
* People with high Social Sensitivity are often highly attuned to the opinions and judgments of those around them, and they may experience feelings of insecurity or embarrassment when they believe they are being closely watched or judged.
* Those lacking Self-Consciousness tend to be confident in who they are and be indifferent to how others see them, though this can easily become aloof. Part of what gives us mindfulness is having some level of self-consciousness.

Captain America has a Self-Consciousness of *15*.

## Immoderation: Difficulty Resisting Temptation
**Immoderation** represents an individual’s tendency to *struggle with self-discipline* and to *act impulsively* when faced with tempting or pleasurable opportunities. They are more likely to prioritize short-term rewards over long-term benefits, making it challenging for them to maintain control when faced with tempting situations.
* People with Difficulty Resisting Temptation often have a harder time saying no to immediate desires, whether those involve food, material indulgences, or other forms of gratification.
* Lacking in Immoderation are those that can control their desires for gratification and indulgences. The desires are there, but there comes the issue of if someone denies themselves pleasures to an extreme.

Sherlock Holmes has an Immoderation of *90*.  
Captain America has an Immoderation of *10*.

## Vulnerability: Susceptibility to Stress
**Vulnerability** represents an individual’s *sensitivity to stressful situations* and how easily they *feel overwhelmed* or *emotionally distressed* when faced with adversity. When confronted with difficult circumstances, they are more likely to experience feelings of helplessness, panic, or emotional breakdown, finding it hard to regain emotional equilibrium.
* People high in Susceptibility to Stress often find it difficult to remain calm and composed in the face of challenges.
* Lacking Vulnerability are able to handle themselves well, especially in a crisis. This has a lot to deal with the fight-or-flight-or-freeze response (also known as Amygdala Hijack), and that there is a strength in being vulnerable as it allows you to better assess a situation.

Anakin Skywalker has a Vulnerability of *90*.  
Tywin Lannister has a Vulnerability of *10*.
