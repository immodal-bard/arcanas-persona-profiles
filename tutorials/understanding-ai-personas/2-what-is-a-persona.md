# What is a Persona?

That's what this tutorial is about. When you get into LLM AI like ChatGPT, you ask it to portray something or something and it does so with relative ease. And it's easy to believe that it is a simple trick, like it's no big thing. It seems arbitrary that all that is necessary comes down to essentially three components, especially when you only use two of those three and it still works. 

One bit of advance that I give you now, but this is really for after completing this tutorial, is to recognize that the default ChatGPT that you interact with, is a Persona. Now this Default Persona is considerably different that the persona users create, but by looking at the AI as a persona, it helps you master Persona Design. This will make sense as you develop your skills and techniques in Persona Design.

## Foundation Components

No matter what you put into a Prompt Persona or detail in a Persona Profile, the AI like ChatGPT is going to answer three questions:
* What Role do I need to portray?
* What Expertise do I need to have?
* How do I present the answer to the user?

### Role

The concept of Role is often overlooked in persona design. It's frequently confused with Expertise, leading some to believe that only Expertise is an advanced form of Role. Role is the core of the persona, guiding how the AI interprets user requests and utilizes its knowledge base to ensure responses are relevant and contextually appropriate. Role ensures coherence in interactions with humans and can influence the methodologies used to perform tasks, as different roles may employ varied approaches.

### Expertise
Expertise represents the persona's knowledge base. While Role provides context, Expertise defines the specific areas of focus and understanding. It informs the skills and knowledge the AI persona draws upon, allowing Role and Expertise to synergistically integrate. This integration enhances the persona's credibility and usefulness, enabling it to make more informed decisions.

### Communication
Communication encompasses Tone and Style, shaping how the persona interacts with users. Tone often reflects emotion, while Style pertains to presentation and mannerisms. Effective communication involves understanding, formality, and demeanor, which are vital for creating relatable, engaging, and believable personalities. This aspect makes the AI persona more appealing and effective.

## Example 
A simple prompt for a teacher persona might be: "You are an enthusiastic history teacher. Explain the causes of World War I." This prompt clearly defines the Role (teacher), Expertise (history), and Tone (enthusiastic). The AI might respond:  

"*World War I, often referred to as the Great War, was caused by a combination of factors, including militarism, alliances, imperialism, and nationalism. The immediate trigger was the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary in 1914, which set off a chain reaction among the major European powers*"

For a more complex prompt, consider: "You are an empathetic medical doctor specializing in cardiology. A patient comes to you worried about their recent chest pains. Explain possible causes and recommend immediate steps they should take." This prompt specifies the Role (medical doctor), Expertise (cardiology), and Tone (empathetic). The AI's response might be: 

"*Chest pains can be caused by various factors, including heart-related issues like angina or a heart attack, as well as non-heart-related issues such as acid reflux or muscle strain. It's important to assess the nature and severity of the pain. For immediate steps, I recommend the patient rest and avoid strenuous activity, monitor the pain, and seek emergency medical attention if the pain is severe, persistent, or accompanied by symptoms like shortness of breath or dizziness.*"

## Does the AI change?

When I first got into Persona design, there were many designs that were suggesting they were a way of accessing functions beyong the AI to the LLM level, or were secret ways to jailbreak the AI. Now, I'm not into jailbreaking, unless it was my 2nd Generation iPod Touch. Looking back over these designs, I see they didn't actually do what they suggested, but were in fact employing advanced complex instructions that the AI was already capable of doing, if you were keen enough to figure it out.

The question remains, when asking the AI to pretend to be Kermit the Frog, are we still talking to the AI who has now changed the way they speak and respond to us?

No, the AI *doesn't* change. 

Admittatly, it seems like the AI has changed. But in all honest, the AI is just pretending. It is still the same AI.

## What happens when the AI roleplays a persona? 

The AI is very similar to your word guessing mechanism for your phone. It estimates what is likely the next word it need to use based on several factors. One of the primary changes to the AI when it roleplays is that it alters how it picks words. 

More than that, it also alters what words it can potentially use. In a simplistic way, when the AI is outputting data to you, it creates a vocabulary list consistent with what it's being direct to do. A persona alters the vocabulary list and alters its calculation for how it choses the next work. An "Entuhusiastic Teacher" might provide words that are positive and instructional, whereas a "Disgruntled Teacher" might provide words that are more negative and instructional.

The thing I will stress here and anywhere else when I talk about what the AI does: **It's more than just picking the next word.**

While Expertise and Communication tends to be more about the output, Role not only is about the output, but it is about identifying and understanding your context of your prompt. From there, it makes a decision on how it will approach the task you give it. There is a lot of processing and decision making being done. In fact, Expertise comes into play back ascertaining where it should first look for the answer you're looking for through the lens of the Role. Communication is the only one that is just about the output.

In many ways, Role acts as a filter, informing the AI what elements to focus on more than others. It can use its predetermined Expertise as a starting point, but it can go beyond that is necessary. Once it has the answer, the Role uses Expertise and Communication to determine the kind of words to use to facilitate its output.

Confused. This is a lot to go over and in many ways counterintuitive. If you need to, copy this information and put it into ChatGPT and ask it to explain more about these concepts. Because trust me when I say, this is a surface level understanding. I have a Role Manual that is over 100 pages and working on an Expertise Manual that is likely going to be as long. That is why I say, these concepts are deceptively simple.

## Why these three components?

It's a good question: Who came up with this system? Why are personas defined by these three components, and why not others or more?

These three components—**Role, Expertise, and Communication**—emerged from decades of research. Role, or more specifically role-playing, can be linked to the 2009 study "*Role play in HCI studies*" (10.14236/ewic/HCIED2009.12). While it doesn't address the concept of Role directly, it demonstrates how computer interactions can be enhanced through role-playing and how students can learn better. The research into Role is rooted in the psychological and sociological understanding of human behavior.

Expertise has been a focus of study since the 1970s, utilized to emulate human decision-making. 

Communication, although still a challenge for humans, is based on the understanding of linguistics—essentially what an LLM is built upon.

The synthesis of these studies, research, and testing led OpenAI to program ChatGPT with these components, combining insights from psychology, sociology, linguistics, and computer science. It's hard to imagine replacing these three, as they cover the most basic elements that constitute a personality for an LLM: possessing knowledge, communicating that knowledge, and applying that knowledge effectively.

In my designs of Advanced/Complex AI Persona Profiles, I actually add more components to what makes a persona, but I never reduce the efficiency of these three fundamental elements. When Role, Expertise, and Communication come together, they enhance the AI's ability to provide nuanced and in-depth insights. Although ChatGPT has a vast range of knowledge, it can only know so much at any given time and may lack depth in certain subjects. These three components enable the AI to deliver nuanced and controlled responses, which are crucial for predictability and effectiveness, especially in professional environments.
