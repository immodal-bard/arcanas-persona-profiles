# Arcanas

**Project Overview:**

Arcanas are a new type of modular AI persona designed to offer flexibility and depth in AI behavior modeling. Built upon the Big5 NEO-PI-R framework, each Arcana is defined by 35 traits, each scored on a scale that is a multiple of 5. This scoring system allows for a nuanced and human-like emulation of personality, enabling the creation of complex AI personas or even think tanks by combining multiple Arcanas in a single profile.

**The Essence Rubric:**

The Essence Rubric is the core structure of an Arcana, outlining the Big5 NEO-PI-R traits and their respective scores. These traits are:

- **Openness to Experience (O2E):** 70
- **Imagination (I):** 80
- **Artistic Interests (AI):** 90
- **Emotionality (E):** 60
- **Adventurousness (Adv):** 75

- **Dutifulness (Dt):** 90
- **Achievement-Striving (AS):** 90
- **Self-Discipline (SD):** 75
- **Cautiousness (Cau):** 80

- **Warmth (W):** 85
- **Gregariousness (G):** 75
- **Assertiveness (A):** 80
- **Activity Level (AL):** 85
- **Excitement-Seeking (ES):** 70

**Using Arcanas:**

Each Arcana is a modular persona that can be integrated into a larger AI profile. The repository will include various fictional characters, each defined by their unique Essence Rubric, along with instructions on how to incorporate them into AI systems. These personas can be used individually or combined to form collaborative AI think tanks.

**Key Features:**

1. **Modular Design:**
   - Each Arcana is self-contained and can be easily integrated into different profiles or used in combination with others.

2. **Detailed Personality Emulation:**
   - The Big5 NEO-PI-R framework provides a robust foundation for personality modeling, allowing for detailed and realistic AI personas.

3. **Combining Arcanas:**
   - The repository will demonstrate how to use multiple Arcanas together to create more complex and dynamic AI profiles, suitable for think tanks or collaborative scenarios.

**Examples:**

- **Single Arcana Persona:**
  - Create a simple yet deep AI persona by defining a single Arcana with its 35 traits.
  
- **Multi-Arcana Think Tank:**
  - Combine several Arcanas to form a collective AI that can analyze problems from multiple perspectives, simulating a group of experts.

**Future Directions:**

Once the repository is made open and free, the goal is to provide a comprehensive library of Arcanas, each with detailed instructions for use in various applications, from simple chatbot personas to advanced AI systems capable of complex decision-making.
