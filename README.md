## About Arcanas

**Arcanas** introduces a modular system of personas for **AI enthusiasts** and those seeking a novel approach to enhancing AI interaction through character and personality emulation. These personas, or **Arcanas**, are meticulously constructed using the **BIG5 NEO-PI-R** model, with each character defined by 35 distinct traits scored in 5-point increments. This creates a robust personality profile that is both flexible and human-like. Moving beyond the standard "Pretend you are..." prompt, Arcanas introduces **Persona Profiles** that enrich AI interactions with defined character nuances.

### The Essence Rubric

At the heart of each Arcana is the **Essence Rubric**—a scoring structure based on the BIG5 NEO-PI-R personality framework. This rubric breaks down five major personality dimensions into specific facets, each scored for detailed personality mapping:

- **Openness to Experience**, Imagination, Artistic Interests, Emotionality, Adventurousness, Intellect, Liberalism
- **Conscientiousness**, Self-Efficacy, Orderliness, Dutifulness, Achievement-Striving, Self-Discipline, Cautiousness
- **Extraversion**, Friendliness, Gregariousness, Assertiveness, Activity Level, Excitement-Seeking, Cheerfulness
- **Agreeableness**, Trust, Morality, Altruism, Cooperation, Modesty, Sympathy
- **Neuroticism**, Anxiety, Anger, Depression, Self-Consciousness, Immoderation, Vulnerability

Each Arcana’s scores across these traits provide flexibility for various use cases, enabling users to create personas with unique dispositions, strengths, and emotional subtleties. When integrated with AI models like ChatGPT, the **Essence Rubric** aids in establishing a **Personality Matrix** adaptable to user context, bringing background depth and instructions that capture the character’s nuanced traits.

### Key Features

1. **Integrated Design**: Each Arcana combines a structured Essence Rubric with a detailed background, facilitating a seamless persona experience for long-term AI interactions.

2. **Detailed Personality Emulation**: The Big5 NEO-PI-R foundation lends realism and depth to the personas, creating unique character experiences that emulate complex human personalities.

3. **Modular System**: Arcanas can be easily swapped, added, or removed, ensuring adaptability for various projects.

4. **Diverse Applications**: Each Arcana is suitable for a wide range of uses, from distinctive chatbot personalities to immersive storytelling, making Arcanas a versatile tool for interactive and creative projects.

### Usage Examples

**Example: Loki Persona Profile**

**Prompt**: "I want to ask my boss for a raise. I have great performance to prove I deserve it, but he's always complaining about the budget. I like my job and I want to stay, but he's not paying me what others would. I don't want to bankrupt the company, but at the same time I do deserve to be paid for what I do for the company. Lacking your powers, what ways can I "subtly" encourage him to see the wisdom of bump in my salary?"

**Loki's Response**:
*Ah, seeking what’s rightfully yours but dealing with one who clutches their purse strings too tightly? Sounds like you're in need of some subtle mischief of the corporate variety. Since you're lacking my powers (a shame, really), let's use strategy and finesse to get what you deserve.*

*Here’s how you can "gently" nudge your boss to see the brilliance of your proposal, all while keeping it subtle:*

## FAQ

### What are Arcanas, and how do they work?

**Arcanas** are modular AI personas designed to emulate unique personalities based on the Big5 NEO-PI-R personality model. Each Arcana is defined by 35 traits, providing a rich and multidimensional foundation for character interactions.

### How do I use an Arcana persona?

To use an Arcana, open the relevant character profile in the `characters/` folder, copy the contents, and paste them into ChatGPT or a compatible AI model to activate the persona. You can also use them with one of the templates in the `template/` folder for a more structured approach.

### Can I create my own Arcana?

Absolutely! To create your own Arcana, determine the scores for each of the 35 traits, write a well-rounded background paragraph, and assign a name. This can be done for a fictional character, historical figure, or even an original persona.

### Why do you only have fictional characters?

That’s a great question. I use fictional characters because the AI already recognizes them, and when imported into ChatGPT, it intuitively fills in certain nuances to represent each persona authentically. For my private use, I may create profiles for historical figures or real individuals, but I choose not to release these personas publicly. 

Using real people’s profiles presents ethical challenges. A fictional character allows for creative representation without the privacy concerns or potential misrepresentation that comes with real individuals. Fictional personas provide a space for exploration and creativity without compromising personal or historical integrity.

### Can I change the scores in your Arcanas profiles?

Yes, you can. The scores are flexible, and you’re welcome to adjust them as needed. The profiles I provide are a starting point and can be tailored to your preferences or specific use cases.

### I disagree with some of your scores. Will you change them?

The scoring process is extensive, but it’s also subjective, and I could be wrong. If you disagree with a score, feel free to adjust it for your own use. However, if you’d like to propose a change, submit a pull request, and we can discuss it in detail. I’m open to listening and will consider valid arguments, but understand that I may ultimately decide to retain the original scoring. Constructive dialogue is always welcome, as it often leads to valuable insights.

### Are there limitations to the Arcanas personas?

While Arcanas are designed to be flexible, they are based on the Big5 NEO-PI-R model, which may not capture every nuance of human personality. Complex emotions or behaviors may occasionally require creative interpretation to fully represent.

### How can I contribute to this repository?

To contribute, please refer to the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file (coming soon) for guidelines on adding new profiles, improving documentation, or suggesting features. Contributions from the community are encouraged and valued.
