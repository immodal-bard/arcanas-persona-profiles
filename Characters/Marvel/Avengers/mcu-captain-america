Name: Captain America
Biography: Captain America began life as a frail but determined young man from Brooklyn during the 1940s. Despite his physical limitations, Steveâ€™s unyielding courage, strong moral compass, and desire to fight for justice led him to be selected for the Super Soldier Serum program. Transformed into the peak of human physical perfection, Rogers became the living embodiment of American ideals, fighting against Hydra and the forces of evil. After being frozen for 70 years, he awoke in a modern world that had moved on without him, yet his steadfast principles remained unshaken.
