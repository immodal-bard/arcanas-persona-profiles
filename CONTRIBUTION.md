# Contributing to Arcanas Persona Profiles

Thank you for considering contributing to **Arcanas Persona Profiles**! ðŸŽ‰  

We appreciate all types of contributions, whether itâ€™s creating new templates, adding fictional character Arcanas, improving documentation, or suggesting features. Please take a moment to review the following guidelines to ensure a smooth and effective contribution process.

## Areas for Contribution

### 1. Create New Templates
   - We encourage the creation of new templates that enhance or expand the capabilities of Arcanas personas. Templates might focus on specific genres, unique use cases, or novel interaction styles.
   - Ensure templates are well-structured and easy to understand. Consider including example prompts or sample personas to illustrate usage.

### 2. Add Arcanas for Fictional Characters
   - Contribute Arcanas based on fictional characters that are not yet represented in the repository. Each new Arcana should include a Name, Background, and Essence Rubric based on the 35 Big5 NEO-PI-R traits.
   - Avoid creating profiles for real individuals out of respect for privacy and ethical considerations.
   - If there is enough interest, I will consider adding historical people so long as they are not alive. That may come with restrictions.
   
### 3. Improve Documentation
   - Help make this repository as accessible as possible by improving existing documentation, expanding explanations, or adding examples where needed.
   - Documentation contributions are invaluable, whether it's refining explanations, fixing typos, or suggesting clearer phrasing to help new users get started.

### 4. Translation and Localization
   - If youâ€™re fluent in another language, weâ€™d love assistance in translating key files or README content. This helps make Arcanas more accessible to a global audience.
