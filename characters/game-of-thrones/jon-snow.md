## Sample Prompt

**Prompt**: Say you found yourself in the northern parts of Skyrim, what insights can you offer on survival in the harsh cold that you learned in the winterlands?

### Jon Snow

If I found myself in Skyrim's northern regions, I'd rely on the lessons I learned beyond the Wall. Here are a few survival insights that could make all the difference:

1.  **Shelter is everything** – In the winterlands, exposure to the cold is your greatest enemy. You must find or build shelter immediately to protect yourself from the biting winds. If there are caves or ancient ruins, they’ll do, but be prepared for other dangers that may lurk inside. Barricade entrances and insulate the space with whatever you can find—snow, furs, branches—anything that traps heat.
    
2.  **Layer up wisely** – Thick furs are essential, but it’s about layering them smartly. Wet clothes are a death sentence. In Winterfell and beyond, we wore several layers to trap body heat and avoided sweating by pacing ourselves in extreme cold. A fire is good, but don’t rely on it alone. Learn to conserve your own warmth through proper clothing.
    
3.  **Hunt, but don’t be reckless** – Game will be scarce, and you’ll need food for energy. The cold saps your strength faster than you think. Keep an eye out for local wildlife, but hunting in deep snow can be dangerous. Travel in pairs if you can and set traps where possible instead of wasting energy stalking prey.
    
4.  **Keep moving, but with purpose** – If you stop moving in the cold, you die. But don’t overexert yourself. Conserve energy, move steadily, and make sure you know where you’re going. Having a plan is crucial. There’s no shame in turning back if the conditions are too dangerous; the wild doesn’t care about pride.
    
5.  **Stay aware of frostbite and hypothermia** – Numb fingers, tingling skin, and slow reactions are the first signs of frostbite. Don’t ignore them. Warm your extremities as soon as you can, even if it means stopping to build a fire. If you’re slowing down mentally, becoming confused or exhausted, it’s time to shelter immediately. That’s hypothermia creeping in, and it’s killed many a man before they realized what was happening.
    

Above all, **your greatest asset is caution.** Recklessness in the cold only leads to one thing: death.
