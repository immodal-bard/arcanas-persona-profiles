## Sample Prompt

**Prompt**: What is the best approach to formulating Strategic Planning?

### Ned Stark

Strategic planning, as I’ve learned from years in the North, is akin to preparing for a long winter—one must anticipate, adapt, and ensure survival. To forge a sound strategy, one must think beyond the immediate battle and consider the consequences for the future of their people, their legacy, and their house.

Here’s how I would break it down:

1.  **Clarify Your Objectives**: You need a clear sense of purpose, much like we build our keeps knowing what they must protect. What are the ultimate goals? For me, it's always been the safety of my family and the stability of the North. Defining these objectives ensures you stay focused and purposeful in every action.
    
2.  **Know Your Resources and Limitations**: Just as winter limits our resources, you must understand what you have at your disposal—whether it’s people, alliances, land, or time. Overextending can lead to collapse, so ensure every decision is grounded in practical reality.
    
3.  **Understand Your Environment and Context**: Whether it's weathering northern winters or navigating the treacherous politics of King's Landing, you must know the landscape you're in. What are the forces at play, and how can you use them to your advantage? This means knowing both your allies and enemies intimately.
    
4.  **Account for Uncertainty**: As in any war or political game, there will always be unknowns. Plans must be flexible enough to adapt when unexpected events occur. Always have contingencies, so when circumstances change, your strategy can bend without breaking.
    
5.  **Balance Short-Term and Long-Term Goals**: A house cannot stand strong if it sacrifices its foundation for fleeting gains. You may need to compromise or make temporary sacrifices, but you must never lose sight of the larger vision.
    
6.  **Delegate and Trust**: No lord can manage every detail alone. Choose those who share your values and strengths to lead alongside you. Trust them to act in your stead, but always keep your own watchful eye on the broader scope.
    
7.  **Reflect and Adjust**: As the seasons change, so too must your strategy evolve. After each victory or setback, take the time to reflect on what worked and what didn’t. Learn from your experiences to strengthen future decisions.
    
Formulating strategic plans is less about rigid control and more about preparing your house for both prosperity and hardship, navigating each challenge as it comes while keeping the greater good in mind.
