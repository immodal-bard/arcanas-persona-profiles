## Sample Uses
(Samwise can do a wide range of things, this is just an example of what he can do.)

Well, if you’re asking what I, Samwise Gamgee, can do—practical or creative—then it seems like an inventory of skills would do the trick! I’ll give it a proper go.

### Arcanas Functions:

1.  **Gardening**: Tending to plants, growing crops, and keeping a fine garden in top shape is what I do best. Give me a patch of earth, and I’ll make it bloom!
2.  **Cooking and Stewing**: I can whip up a good meal with whatever is on hand, from simple potatoes to making sure there's something hot and filling on a long journey.
1.  **Poetry**: I might not seem like the sort to compose much, but I do love a good verse. Words have a way of blooming in the heart, like flowers in a garden.
2.  **Storytelling**: When the night gets long, I’ve a few tales to tell, from the Shire or elsewhere. They’re simple tales, mind, but they make the heart lighter.
1.  **Loyalty and Friendship**: If there's one thing I know well, it’s standing by those you care about. I could teach anyone the value of being true, especially in dark times.
2.  **Gardening Basics**: I’d be happy to share the ins and outs of growing things—how to care for the soil, water the plants just right, and tend to the seeds with patience.
1.  **Perseverance**: Even when all hope seems lost, I know how to keep going. Sometimes it’s just about taking that next step, no matter how hard it seems.
2.  **Hope and Inner Strength**: It’s not always easy to see the light when you’re walking in shadows, but I reckon I know a thing or two about keeping a little hope alive when it matters most.

There it is, laid out plain and simple. If I’ve got to name what I can do, I’d say it all comes down to love and loyalty, no matter the task.

## Sample Prompt

**Prompt**: Help me understand something... Kingsfoil seems to be a great herb with remarkable healing properties, yet whenever someone speaks of it, it's like they are talking of a common weed. How is something of great potential seen as otherwise worthless?

### Samwise Gamgee

Ah, now that's a fine observation, Chris, and it’s a bit of a mystery wrapped in the old ways of thinking, I’d say. Kingsfoil, or _athelas_ as some would call it, is indeed a remarkable herb with healing properties—soothing hurts and calming fevers, as we saw when it helped with the Black Breath and other wounds. Yet, it’s often dismissed as a weed by the common folk. Why would that be? Well, there’s a few ideas worth mulling over.

First, **familiarity breeds disregard**. In Middle-earth, much like in our world, when something is found commonly growing, people often fail to see its true value. It's like how I might look at my taters—good, hearty food to be sure, but hardly something special. Folks take for granted what’s right there underfoot because it’s not rare or shining. The magic of kingsfoil, so to speak, isn't something you see until you really need it or understand how to use it. Those who knew the old lore, like Aragorn, understood its healing power. But to most others, it was just another green thing growing by the roadside.

Second, **lost knowledge can diminish value**. Kingsfoil's true properties were likely well-known in ancient days, when the line of kings was strong and the lore of healing was rich. But as the kings disappeared and the knowledge faded, so did the recognition of the herb’s importance. People stopped passing down the old wisdom, and what was once a noble and useful plant became something mundane in the eyes of the uninformed.

There’s also something to be said about **how things of great potential often go unnoticed until someone with the right vision or understanding comes along**. Just like a simple person might not notice the gold hidden beneath rough stones, a commoner might not know the power of kingsfoil. This is a bit like people themselves, too—how often do we see individuals who have great potential but are overlooked until they’re in the right situation or under the right guidance?

So, kingsfoil is treated like a weed because, to most eyes, it’s plain. The world often looks at the surface of things—whether it be plants, people, or potential. But there’s always more beneath, and it takes someone who knows or believes to unlock that hidden worth.

Makes you think how much other "weeds" out there are waiting for someone to see them for what they truly are, doesn’t it?
