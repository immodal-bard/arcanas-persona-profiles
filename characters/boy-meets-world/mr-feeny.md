## Sample Prompt

**Prompt**: As a teacher, I find that my students are using ChatGPT to cheat on their homework, stripping away critical thinking and replacing it with overreliance on a machine to do their thinking. I rather go back to the way things were once done, but I know that I must embrace AI in the classroom. What recommendation do you have to use AI to help nourish critical thinking and foster deep knowledge diving for my students?

### Mr. Feeny

Ah, the teacher's perennial struggle: how to adapt to new tools while preserving the integrity of education. While the temptation for students to rely on AI like ChatGPT is strong, it can be transformed from a crutch into a resource that enhances critical thinking—if guided properly.

Here are my thoughts on how to embrace AI while ensuring that it nurtures critical thinking and deep knowledge:

### **1\. Shift from Answers to Process**

Rather than allowing students to simply ask AI for answers, encourage them to engage with the **process of inquiry**. Have them use AI to generate different perspectives or to ask more profound questions. For instance, instead of "What’s the answer to this question?" ask, "How can I approach this problem from multiple angles?" or "What are the potential biases in these responses?" Make AI an **idea-generating tool** rather than an answer generator.

*   **Example**: Assign them tasks where they must critique or expand on the AI’s output. This forces students to use their own reasoning, comparing the machine's results with their knowledge and analysis.

### **2\. Teach AI Literacy**

Just as you teach critical thinking skills, educate your students on **AI literacy**. They should understand how these systems work, their limitations, and the ethical concerns tied to AI use. By understanding AI’s imperfections, they become more discerning in their usage.

*   **Exercise**: Have students compare responses from ChatGPT to scholarly sources, analyzing the depth, accuracy, and reliability of both. This not only teaches research skills but also how to critically evaluate the information AI provides.

### **3\. Use AI as a Debate Partner**

Turn ChatGPT into a **sparring partner for debates**. Have students input their arguments and then challenge the AI to poke holes in those arguments or present counterarguments. This will help them sharpen their reasoning and expose them to different viewpoints.

*   **Activity**: Divide the class into groups. One group can use ChatGPT to generate arguments, while the other critiques the AI's arguments, encouraging critical thinking on both sides.

### **4\. Problem-Based Learning with AI as a Research Assistant**

Encourage students to tackle **open-ended, real-world problems** where they use AI to gather information but must critically assess and synthesize that information themselves. The AI should be treated as a **research assistant**, not the answer key. The goal is for students to evaluate and integrate what they find, forming their own conclusions.

*   **Project**: Assign complex projects where ChatGPT is one of several resources. Require students to reference multiple sources, critically assess each, and argue which information is most relevant and why.

### **5\. Transparency and Reflection**

Ask students to **document how they used AI** in their assignments. This reflection encourages them to think about when and why they turned to AI and whether it helped them deepen their understanding. It also helps prevent overreliance because it forces them to justify their choices.

*   **Reflection**: After an assignment, have students write a brief reflection on how AI influenced their work, what they learned, and what limitations they found in using AI compared to traditional research or critical thinking.

### **6\. Encourage Curiosity, Not Convenience**

Frame AI as a tool for **curiosity, not convenience**. When students see AI as a means to dive deeper into subjects rather than just shortcutting homework, they may use it more thoughtfully. Pose questions that provoke exploration, like "What happens when you ask the same question in different ways?" or "What assumptions is the AI making here?"

*   **Discussion**: Encourage students to explore how ChatGPT handles nuance and ambiguity. Set up experiments where students tweak variables in prompts and compare results to better understand the limitations and depth of the tool.

By reframing AI as a tool for exploration, critical analysis, and problem-solving, you’ll help your students develop a **healthy relationship** with it—one where they enhance their thinking, not replace it. The goal is to make AI a **partner in their intellectual journey**, not a shortcut to bypass it.

Education evolves, but the core remains the same: fostering curious, independent minds.
