We are committed to fostering a welcoming and inclusive environment for all members of our community. This Code of Conduct outlines the standards of behavior expected from all contributors and participants in our project. These guidelines are in place to ensure that everyone feels respected, safe, and empowered to participate.

## Our Pledge

In the interest of creating an open and inclusive community, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to:
- Respect all participants, regardless of their background, experience, or identity.
- Encourage a collaborative and inclusive environment where constructive feedback and ideas are shared freely.
- Foster a space for learning and mentorship, ensuring that no one is afraid to ask questions or seek help.
- Promote professionalism and be mindful of how words and actions may be perceived by others.
- Help others resolve conflicts before escalating and encourage positive interactions.

We are committed to upholding these standards and ensuring that all participants can contribute in a safe and respectful environment.

## Our Standards

To ensure a positive environment, we encourage the following behaviors:

### Positive Behaviors (Encourage):
- **Respect and Collaboration**: Treat everyone with dignity and work together toward common goals.
- **Constructive Feedback and Graceful Acceptance**: Provide helpful, polite feedback and be open to receiving constructive criticism.
- **Inclusivity and Mindfulness**: Welcome participants from all backgrounds and consider how your words and actions may affect others.
- **Resolving Prior to Escalation**: Seek to resolve misunderstandings or disagreements before escalating them publicly.
- **Cognizant of Appearance**: Be aware of how your conduct and words might be understood by others, and take the extra moment to clarify intentions.
- **Professionalism**: Maintain a professional attitude, even in disagreements.

- **Piranhaing**: Offering to trade ideas but failing to reciprocate or misrepresenting the value of what you intend to share.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

As the project maintainer, I (and future collaborators) will be responsible for enforcing this Code of Conduct. Reports of violations will be taken seriously and addressed promptly, with the goal of resolving conflicts fairly and transparently.

---

## Reporting Violations

If you experience or witness any behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, you are encouraged to report it via email to:
**Email**: [abstractinferential@proton.me](mailto:abstractinferential@proton.me)

All reports will be handled with discretion and confidentiality. We are committed to ensuring the privacy of those reporting violations.

---

## Enforcement Process

We believe in giving people a fair chance to correct their behavior before escalating consequences. The following tiered approach will be used for violations:

1. **First Offense**: A private, written warning will be issued, explaining the nature of the violation and providing guidance for how to avoid future issues.
2. **Second Offense**: Temporary restrictions from participation will be imposed (e.g., restricted access to commenting or contributing) for a set period of time.
3. **Third Offense**: Permanent ban from the project and community, including all related spaces (e.g., issues, pull requests, discussions).

For particularly severe violations, such as harassment, doxxing, or deliberate sabotage, an immediate ban may be issued without prior warnings.

---

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all interactions within the project repository, including GitHub discussions, issues, pull requests, and any related project spaces. While we strongly encourage members to uphold these standards beyond the repository (e.g., on social media or external forums), our ability to enforce behavior outside of the project space is limited. Violations that occur within the project repository may result in a ban from the project.

---

## Annual Review

This Code of Conduct will be reviewed annually to ensure that it remains relevant and effective. Updates will be made as necessary based on community feedback or changes in the project's structure or audience.

---

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is based on the Contributor Covenant, version 2.1, available at https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct.html, with additional modifications to reflect the specific needs and values of our community.

Simply paste this document and your intended message into ChatGPT and ask it to help determine if your message aligns with these guidelines. While this method may not be 100% accurate, it can help you identify areas to clarify or adjust.

This practice is encouraged to ensure all contributions foster a respectful, collaborative, and positive environment for everyone involved.
