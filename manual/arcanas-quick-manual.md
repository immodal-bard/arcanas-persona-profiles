# Introduction

Welcome to the Arcanas respository. 

This type of Persona design might seem quite unusal to you. Most of you may be aware of Prompt Persona designs, which instruct you to define the Role, Expertise, and Tone. Arcanas differ from that to introduce the concept of Peronsa Profiles, a more efficient way to do Personas with the AI. 

## Why is it called Arcanas?

I call this Arcanas to help differentiate it from other profile designs. Arcanas describe a modular approach to profile design that many other levels of persona design lack. The reason I call it Arcanas is due to Tarot cards. Arcana generally means "new magic, new energy, new life". I focus more on the last one in a metaphorical sense, that with these persona profiles, we are creating something we can interact with. Not life, per say, but what we do with Arcanas is distinct in how we approach Human-to-AI interaction.

## How do I use an Arcana?

Under Templates is a Basic Arcana Profile Template. Follow the instructions there for creating a persona based on a fictional character that you want them to carry out specific instructions. Just paste in a profile from the character directory.

You can also check out the Tricorder template. Paste in a character profile and this will augment their capabilities as a persona.
